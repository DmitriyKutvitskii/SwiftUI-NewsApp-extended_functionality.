# SwiftUI-NewsApp-extended_functionality.

The project is written in pure SwiftUI, without the use of libraries and third-party resources. Happy use!) 

For the application to work on your device, you need to create an account at "https://newsapi.org/". The key that you will receive upon registration must be inserted into "API" -> "Key" -> "struct APIKey"
